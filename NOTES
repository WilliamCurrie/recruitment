Forked repo at about 13:10

Docker broken, wouldn't start (this problem: https://www.google.com/search?q=docker+archlinux+The+unit+docker.socket+has+entered+the+%27failed%27+state+with+result+%27service-start-limit-hit%27.+2020&oq=docker&aqs=chrome.0.69i59l3j69i57j69i60l3.2159j0j1&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8)
(It was working fine for months, I last used it about 3 weeks ago.)

Reboot appeared to fix it (docker appears to start), but 'docker-compose up' gave this error:
    Creating network "recruitment_default" with the default driver
    Creating volume "recruitment_dbdata" with default driver
    Building app
    ERROR: Error processing tar file(exit status 1): Error cleaning up after pivot: remove /.pivot_root754256099: device or resource busy

and 'docker ps' gives: Cannot connect to the Docker daemon at unix:///var/run/docker.sock. Is the docker daemon running?

Failed to fix within 30 minutes. Uninstalled docker, tried to reinstall. No dice, complaining about /etc/mtab not existing, which it does.

This system's knackered I think. Will take time to fix. Will try and install docker on win 10...

13:55 - after reading how to install docker on my particular version of windows (Home, version 1909) it promises to be an adventure I'd rather not go on at the moment!

Will go to my faithful linux server, set up environment there (with Apache), database, wrestle with selinux etc...


14:35 - got a working environment. Had problems with SSL, so due to lack of time I'm just using apache's default dir virtualhost on port 80.
