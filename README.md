# Recruitment Exercise - Refactored

I've refactored the code into several files using a very basic MVC structure. No frameworks have been used.
Oridnarily this would be more advanced to allow for full URLS, 404s etc.

I've also written a custom JS class (ES6) to handle AJAX requests for the "View Bookings" button on the page.

# Technical

Written using NetBeans for PHP 7.2 on a virtual machine with KDE Neon (Ubuntu) running Apache and MariaDB, although full testing was carried out using the PHP -S command.

The Javascript file (js/showoff.js) is written using ES6 syntax so will run on any modern browser _except_ IE11 and below. 

#Finally

Forgive the basic layout - my speciality is coding, _not_ design!
