# Docker
Didn't use it as I was coding on Windows 10 and was running Home not professional or enterprise. Because it has an index file should just be able to point an apache webserver to the public directory and it'll work.

# Composer
Pulled in a few packages with composer so you'll need to run `composer install` first

# Database
I've modified the structure of the init.sql to change some columns to some slightly more conforming names
